# Intro

To run a project you'll need a current project and web template. After a build, you'll need to input `What website are we building today?` and the `magic` starts - the project will be generated using your needs (input) and the template you provide with the power of OpenAI.

## Web teemplate

1. Download Web_template from `https://github.com/chavychaze/web_template.git`

### Setup a project

1. Update `.env` variables
2. Update constant paths to web_template files in the `src/helpers/general.rs`

## Run tests

```bash
cargo test tests_call_to_openai -- --nocapture
```

## Run Project

```bash
cargo build
cargo build --release
cargo run
```

### Warning

For now work the best with `gpt-4-turbo`

### Sample input
